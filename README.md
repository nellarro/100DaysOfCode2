# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: October 16, 2017
#### Rabbit Modal 

**Today's Progress**: 
Created the boilerplate for the rabbit gif that I'll be teaching a co-worker how to make! Downloaded Inkscape to start creating the bunny and hat SVG.

**Thoughts:** 
Spelling is hard. I used to be a great speller before I became a dev. There was a point where showModal wasn't closing because I spelled showModal in one place as showModel. *sigh*

**Goals:**
Create the hat in Inkscape tomorrow.
